 *   <li>COMPLETED - Instance completed successfully (from workflow.instance.completed)

 *   <li>CANCELLED - Instance was cancelled (from workflow.instance.cancelled)
 *   <li>SUSPENDED - Instance execution paused (from workflow.instance.suspended)

 * v1.0.0 uses string status values aligned with SW 1.0.0 spec.
